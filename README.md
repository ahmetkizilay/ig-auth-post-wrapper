# IG-AUTH-POST-WRAPPER

This is a simple project to handle step two of Instagram OAuth process. This app contains the client_secret, and returns the access___token_ and basic user data back as the response.

The _client_\__secret_ value is stored in the ```config\config.(env).json``` files. I added my development config file to the .gitignore. So, make sure you setup your own config file with your own _client_\__secret_ etc.
